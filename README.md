# CAN Gateway Project
# What the Customer Wanted
The client requested a CAN-bus gateway to block existing signals, edit them, and resend them on the CAN-bus. They required a prototype proof of concept to manipulate signals, opting for a CAN gateway over development signals and a separate node via the OBD port.
# What I Did
- Concept Creation: Designed and implemented the CAN gateway.
- Equipment: Purchased MCP-2515 CAN motherboards and other necessary components.
- Hardware Setup: Created wiring and boards for input.
- Business Plan: Delivered including external suppliers, risks, and cost analysis.
- Coding: Developed C++ code for operation.
- Testing: Used CANoe trace and replication to validate the gateway.
# Results and Impact
Successfully built and demonstrated a fully functional CAN gateway.
Enabled the client to manipulate CAN-bus signals effectively.
Provided a robust proof of concept with potential for future development.
